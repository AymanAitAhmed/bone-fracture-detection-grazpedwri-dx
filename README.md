# Bone Fracture Detection in Pediatric Wrist Trauma X-ray Images

This project focuses on detecting bone fractures in pediatric wrist trauma X-ray images using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8s model. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and a carefully curated dataset, we aim to improve detection accuracy and support healthcare professionals in early fracture diagnosis.

## Overview

Pediatric wrist fractures are among the most common injuries, and rapid, accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project explores the application of deep learning to assist in fracture detection using X-ray images, with a focus on performance optimization and model accuracy.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Used**: The [GRAZPEDWRI-DX]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonroggy/grazpedwri-dx]) dataset, a specialized collection of pediatric wrist X-rays, was used in this study. The dataset includes various cases of fractures and non-fractures, providing a robust basis for training and testing the model.

## Model

- **YOLOv8s**: A pre-trained YOLOv8s model was selected for this project due to its efficiency in object detection and high accuracy in medical image applications.
- The model was fine-tuned specifically for fracture detection in pediatric wrist X-rays, allowing it to adapt to the unique characteristics of pediatric bone structures.

## Image Preprocessing

In order to compare the effect that each technique has on the results of training we will be applying a pipeline that consists of the original images that each have different dimensions, after this we take each one of the images and apply the letterboxing technique on them to obtain an images that all have the same dimensions which are 640x640px, furthermore we will take three copies of all the 20327 images and for the first copy we leave them as they are so that we use them as reference, for the second copy we will apply the advanced histogram equalization(AHE) technique:

For the last copy we will apply the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization(CLAHE):

In the end we will train the yolo model on each copy of the three copy and compare the results.

### Libraries Used

The following libraries were critical for implementing image transformations and model training:

- **[Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/)**: Used for advanced image augmentations and transformations to improve the modelâ€™s robustness and performance.
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)**: Utilized for image processing tasks, including CLAHE and HE transformations.

## Results and Observations

The model's performance was analyzed using various metrics, such as confusion matrix, mAP50 and mAP95. The impact of each image transformation method on these metrics was carefully evaluated, offering insights into optimal preprocessing techniques for pediatric wrist X-rays.
